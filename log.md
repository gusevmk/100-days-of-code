# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Did create git repository, Recalled Python syntax, solved "Rot13 Ð¡ipher" task on codewars.com 

**Thoughts:** It was realy to hard to recall Python synax after two months break. Seems I need to reread first part of the Mark Lutz book :DD
